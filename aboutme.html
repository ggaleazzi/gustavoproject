     I am Gustavo from Brazil, but traveling and working abroad for the last 3 years<br />
    I studied farming engineering as my bachelor and later did a lot of farming volunteer in Europe<br />
   to learn more about the practical side and to understand what I wanted to do with my life <br />
    and realized that my desires went in the direction of not having an office job or something that  <br />
     holds me in a specific place, so my parents suggested to go in the website programming direction  <br />
     as I met some digital nomads I thought that their life style would fit me well and here I am to learn bit by bit. </b><br />
     
 <p align="center" >   The idea mostly came because I like to fix things and find solutions for problems<br/>
   going from electrical, plumbering, broken things, and computer problems </b></p>
 <p align="center";> <i>once I studied a bit of Pascal language and it seemed quite logical, so website programming is not so awkward to me. </i></p>
   <p></p>
 <p align="center"; style="color:red;" >   I have also a blog where I share some of my farming experiences around Europe, is writen in 4 languages, and German for practice</p>
 <p align="center"; style="color:red;" >   Most of my practical experience are in farms, until today I volunteered in more then 30 places in Finland, Germany, Italy, France, Spain, Portugal and USA.</p>
 <p align="center"; style="color:red;" >  I am really excited for the website programmming journey and where is going to lead me. </p>
